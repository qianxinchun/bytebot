# MVP Motivation

This repository exists to support the creation of a minimal Bytebot MVP so I can deeply understand how to architect and implement an agent. By focusing on the smallest end-to-end loop, I can study planning, execution, and feedback without distractions, iterate quickly, and document every lesson along the way.
